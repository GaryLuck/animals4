Please write a classic  text game as a Go program. The
user thinks of an animal and the program asks questions about the
properties of the animal, like does it walk or swim. Eventually the
program will say is it an X, and if the user is not thinking of
X, the program will ask what differentiates an X from what you are
thinking of, the user's answer is added to the data structure that
the program is keeping. The program should store the answers in a file,
so over time the program will become more and more knowledgeable about
the properties of animals. The data structure used is typically a
tree. The data structure should start with the question is it a human? (yes or no)?
If the user say yes, the computer wins. If the user says no, 
then the program should ask what the user was thinking of, and what differentiates
the user's animal from a human, and adds that to the database. The game is run
over and over. when the user indicates they are done, the database should be
be written to a file for subseqent executions of the game.
